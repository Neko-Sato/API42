# Project Overview

This project was independently created by lifesaver hshimizu during the Piscine at 42Tokyo to allow lifeservers to monitor the progress of pisciners' tasks.

It includes functionalities for easily interacting with the API and various other scripts.

Of course, you can understand what it does just by looking at the code, so there are no explanations provided.
